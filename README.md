# ![SDCCT Logo](sdcct-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/sdcct/static/images/sdcct-logo-48x48.png) The Structured Data Capture Conformance Tool (SDCCT) Project

<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>
    The Structured Data Capture Conformance Tool (SDCCT) is an interactive tool for validating the conformance of Structured Data Capture (SDC) actors to the IHE and HL7 FHIR SDC implementation guides.

<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>
    The use of electronic health record (EHR) data for secondary purposes is limited due to a lack of uniformity in data structure, transport,
    and definitions across EHR systems. Streamlining EHR data in a structured way can accelerate quality and safety improvements,
    improve population health, and foster scientific research.
</p>
<p>
    The SDC Initiative provides an infrastructure for capturing, exchanging, and using patient data in EHR systems for clinical research,
    and adverse event reporting, and public health reporting. SDC is comprised of form, data element, pre-population,
    and transport components which provide a mechanism for linking structured EHR data to external data repositories. This
    model helps advance clinical quality and safety, population health, and research.
</p>
<p>
    SDC forms are an efficient mechanism to achieve interoperability with standardized structured clinical content. This project was funded by the
    <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/patient-centered-outcomes-research-trust-fund">Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) Trust Fund</a>,
    managed by the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/">Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)</a> in the U.S.
